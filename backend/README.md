## Recipe Taxonomy

This taxonomy is a way where we can categorize recipes in a way that makes sense to users. It is not meant to be a comprehensive list of all possible categories, but rather a list of categories that are useful for the purposes of this application. The categories are as follows:

1. Cuisine: This category includes the various types of cuisines or cultural traditions that a recipe belongs to. Examples might include Italian, Mexican, Chinese, French, Indian, Thai, Japanese, and so on.
2. Course: This category refers to the part of the meal that a recipe is intended for, such as appetizers, main dishes, side dishes, desserts, and so on.
3. Type of dish: This category includes more specific types of dishes, such as soups, salads, sandwiches, burgers, pasta dishes, rice dishes, casseroles, and so on.
4. Diet: This category includes recipes that are suitable for specific dietary needs or preferences, such as vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, low-carb, and so on.
5. Occasion: This category includes recipes that are suitable for specific occasions or events, such as holidays, parties, and so on.
6. Cooking method: This category includes recipes that use specific cooking techniques or methods, such as baking, grilling, slow cooking, and so on.
7. Preparation time: This category includes recipes that can be prepared in a certain amount of time, such as 30 minutes or less, 1 hour or less, and so on.

Under `/data/` there are the seed lists for each of these taxonomies.
